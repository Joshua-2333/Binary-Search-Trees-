# Binary-Search-Trees-
This project implements a **Balanced Binary Search Tree** (BST) in JavaScript, supporting insertion, deletion, traversal, depth/height calculations, balance checking, and rebalancing.

## Features

- Node and Tree classes
- Duplicate-free BST
- Auto-balanced tree construction from an array
- Traversals:
  - Level Order (Breadth-First)
  - Inorder
  - Preorder
  - Postorder
- Insert/Delete operations
- Height and depth lookup
- Balance checking
- Rebalancing
- Pretty-print visualization

## Driver Script Functionality

The main.js script will:

    Generate a random array of numbers under 100.

    Build a balanced BST from it.

    Confirm the tree is balanced.

    Print values using all four traversal methods.

    Unbalance the tree by inserting large values (>100).

    Confirm the tree is unbalanced.

    Rebalance the tree.

    Confirm the tree is now balanced again.

    Print traversals again after rebalancing.

### Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)

#### Running the Project

1. Clone the repo or download the files locally.
2. Run the driver script using:

node main.js
